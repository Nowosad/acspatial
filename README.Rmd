The goal of **acspatial** is to provide a function to calculate the layered block decomposition method (layered BDM) for spatial data.
The layered BDM is a method to estimate the algorithmic complexity of spatial data, a measure of the amount of information in a data set.
The algorithmic complexity is calculated using the Kolmogorov complexity, which is the length of the shortest computer program that can generate the provided data set. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of **acspatial** from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Nowosad/acspatial")
```

## Examples

```{r}
library(acspatial)
# 1
data(mini_array)
mini_array
layered_bdm(mini_array)

# 2
mini_array2 = matrix(1, nrow = 8, ncol = 8)
mini_array2
layered_bdm(mini_array2)
```
